                Hi, I’m Shahzad Alkozay—a passionate programmer currently living in Germany. I’m studying software development, and I can honestly say I’m truly enjoying every moment of it. There’s something incredibly exciting about solving problems with code and seeing ideas come to life through technology. I’ve always been curious about how things work, and that curiosity naturally led me to the world of programming. As I continue learning new languages, tools, and concepts,
                I feel more and more confident that this is exactly where I’m meant to be. Software development challenges me, inspires me, and motivates me to keep growing—not just as a developer, but as a person. I’m excited for the journey ahead and everything I’ll get to build along the way.
